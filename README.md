Trying to create a simple pomodoro app using Elm as a starter project.

Goals:

1. Create a timer that can conditionally count down from 25, 15, or 5.
2. Create a to do list that keeps track of all the things I'm working on in the pomodoro, and only caries over things i didn't complete.
3. Keeps a running tally of how many pomodoros a task has spanned over if not completed.
