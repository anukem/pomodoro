Trying to create a simple pomodoro app using Elm as a starter project.

Goals:

- [ x ] _Create a timer that can conditionally count down from 25, 15, or 5._

- [ x ] Create a to do list that keeps track of all the things I'm working on in the pomodoro, and only caries over things i didn't complete.

3. Keeps a running tally of how many pomodoros a task has spanned over if not completed.
